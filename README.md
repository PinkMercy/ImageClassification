Image Classifier App
The Image Classifier App is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and TensorFlow for image classification. The app allows users to select an image and leverages the InceptionV3 model for accurate image classification. The user-friendly interface includes buttons to choose an image and run the classifier, and the results are displayed with labels and confidence scores. The project uses popular Python libraries such as Pillow for image manipulation and NumPy for efficient data handling. This repository serves as a foundation for a simple yet powerful image classification tool, demonstrating the integration of deep learning models into interactive applications.

Features:
Tkinter-based GUI for easy interaction.
Utilizes TensorFlow and InceptionV3 for image classification.
Supports various image formats (jpg, png, jpeg).
Displays results with labels and confidence scores.

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (PIL (Pillow) , Tkinter-based , TensorFlow ).
Run the application (python image_classifier_app.py).
Select an image and observe the classification results.
